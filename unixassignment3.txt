I created a file File1

1 The 10th to 25th  lines in a file                                ​--> head -25 File1 | tail -n+10

2 List only 10th line in a file​                                    --> head -10 f1 | tail -1

3 List only the recently modified file in the current directory​    --> ls -l | find . -mtime +1 -print

4  List only the smallest file in the current directory​            -->ls -lsr | sort

5  A data file is updated regularly, each day with 10 new records
New records are appended at the end.
Write the command to print total number of records in the file.​    -->ls -lsr | sort -r

6 Write the command to list only the records entered 3 days before -->find . -mtime +3 -print
